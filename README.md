This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# MMA Aliance 

This is an ecommernce web application created with ReactJS, Node-Sass, Redux, Axios, NodeJs(express), JWT, and PostgreSQL

Deployed Link: "https://mma-frontend.vercel.app/"

Backend Repo can be found here: "https://github.com/Gabe0214/MMA-Backend"

I've been a fan of mixed martial arts, so I thought I'd build an ecommernce project that sells MMA equipment, gear and clothing.


## Overview

Users can view products and add products to their cart. Users must create an account to purchase items.
Users can filter and sort through products for easy and fast accessibility. 
Users can view order purchases in their dashboard, and user information. 


## Imporvements

There is a lot of room for imporment. This project isn't completely finshed; there is still some components to optimize and refactor.

I plan on implementing a more secure authentication system other than JWT, such as firebase auth or auth0.
In addition, I plan to implement an api payment system for better user experience such as stripe or paypal.
Currently, the sorting and filtering functionality is only usable in the  `/products/all`  route. It will be added to the other product routes.
Users can currently filter by brand, soon users will have more options to filter by such as color.

These are a few improvements I can think of currently. I know there's whole bunch more.










<!-- In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
